# Configure a static site through AWS S3

It's super cheap. That is until you get a bill that says it isn't. Doesn't matter, since Amazon already has your credit card on file so you will pay either way.

The whole [sad state of affairs is here to read.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)

So let's get going shall we?

***
<hr class="rule">

## Create three buckets

The site will need three instances. root, www, and logs. Create a bucket for each with the exact domain name.

For instance:

+ fucktheweb.com
+ www.fucktheweb.com
+ logs.fucktheweb.com

Enable the root site *fucktheweb.com* for web hosting. Go to the **Properties** panel, click **Static Website Hosting**, and do the following:

1. Select the **Enable website hosting**.
2. In the **Index Document** box, add index.html.
3. In the **Error Document** box, add 404.html.

## Make the root public

In the *fucktheweb.com* bucket **Properties** panel, click the **Permissions**.

1. Click Add **Bucket Policy**.
2. Drop this puppy in

<pre>
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[{
	"Sid":"PublicReadForGetBucketObjects",
        "Effect":"Allow",
	  "Principal": "*",
      "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::fucktheweb.com/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

***

## Set up the redirect

In the *www.fucktheweb.com* bucket **Properties** go to **Static Website Hosting**.

1. Select **Redirect all requests to another host name**
2. **Redirect all requests to:** fucktheweb.com

***

## Enable logging

In the *logs.fucktheweb.com* bucket, create a folder named "root".

In the *fucktheweb.com* bucket **Properties** panel, click **Logging**.

1. Check **Enabled**.
2. **Target bucket:** logs.fucktheweb.com
3. **Target prefix:** root/

# Point the domain

Well, that was fun. Now we get to go through another super groovy interface that costs more money. It's Amazon's signature "Route 53" and we need to set up a "hosted zone".

Well, it's not *that* expensive. But if you want to use any fancy cloud stuff thier signature cloudfront stuff *is*. You can alternately use [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), where you can roll a freebie one site version that routes the site *and* provides a little cloud juice for speed.

# Route 53 way

***

## Create a new hosted zone

In Route 53, go to **Hosted zones** and **create a new hosted zone** called fucktheweb.com. This will generate the namesevers. These nameservers are not consistent when generated, so if you botch it and start over, make sure to check them again before you point. You'll also need to **config two new A records in Route 53** because simple nameservers would be too easy.

***

## Create a root A record

In the new fucktheweb.com hosted zone, **create a record set**.

1. **Name:** leave blank
2. **Type:** A - IPv4 address
3. **Alias:** *- S3 website endpoints -* fucktheweb.com (s3-website-...)
4. **Routing Policy:** Simple

***

## Create a www. A record

1. **Name:** www
2. **Type:** A - IPv4 address
3. **Alias:** *- S3 website endpoints -* fucktheweb.com (s3-website-...)
4. **Routing Policy:** Simple

***

# Change Nameservers

Now go to the registrar and use the Route 53 generated Nameservers to point the domain to S3.
