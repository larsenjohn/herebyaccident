# Youtube custom closed captioning

Youtube has a really fancy auto detect for closed captioning, but if you have a bunch of proprietary branding things go a little haywire. Simplest way to go about this is to transcribe everything in a plain text document beforehand.

You can also upload a full blow transcription file with best practices, but this works in a pinch.

## Navigate to the CC settings

The easiest way to get there is to navigate to your public (or private) video url and click the "CC" icon in the control bar under the video.

1. Add new subtitles or CC
2. Choose: English
3. Choose: Transcribe and auto-sync
4. Select: Set Timings
5. Let it propigate for a minute
6. Select: publish

## Check settings

It should now default to your "English" title. If you need to edit the transcriptions, click on your new CC and select the "Edit" button. In each table will be split up based on the automated time settings.
