# AngularJS is outdated already #

So, of course I have to know everything. It's expected as such. So, I decided to start my whipping torture with AngularJS. *Note* I called it "AngularJS", because this is already outdated apparently. The new version is just "Angular" I guess - and much harder.

Fuck it.

## The basic nausea ##

Alright, if you are a real developer - you are making "apps". I'm just making basic BS - so I'll start here. Brute force, just load the library and get to bronze tacks. Looks like you can just drop the fucker in like JQuery.

```
<body ng-app="" class="dev">

<!-- Load Angular at the top -->
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.18/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.18/angular-route.min.js"></script>

<h1>Angular! I'm so modern!</h1>

</body>
```

Don't call me out on the `angular-route.min.js` cus I don't even know if I need it now, but I guess it will help later with other shit.

Now, the allmighty W3C says it's best to load this in the ~ gasp ~ head. That, or right below the body. One special note - Angular is developed by Google. It will be interesting to see if Google actually **knows it made this** - because I'll bet real money this won't fly with their page speed "insights"... But, I'm tired today.

They got a bunch of **cool named shit to hook this up**, but I guess all you have to do is drop `ng-app=""` in the wrapper and you have the "superhero" framework all ready to go.

```
<!-- holy cow it's ng-app="" -->
<body ng-app="" class="dev">
  <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.18/angular.min.js"></script>
    <p>index me jerk</p>
</body>
```

```
<body>
  <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.18/angular.min.js"></script>

  <!-- nah, I'm in a div -->
  <div ng-app="">
    <p>I'm a real app yo</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

## Using some basic JS ##

Now, all the docs go right for logical strings and shit I just don't understand. The people I know just want shit the moves around and looks expensive.

I just want a click toggle. In fact, that's hard for me alone - so super point for me not having to learn that.

Angular's special sauce starts with `ng-`, and you can click toggle like so:

```
ng-click="toggle= !toggle"
ng-class="{'is-active': toggle}"
```

So terms and idiot like me can understand:

```
<!-- I'm a fancy menu. my toggle class will be .is-active -->
<button ng-click="toggle= !toggle" ng-class="{'is-active': toggle}" class="hamburger hamburger--collapse" type="button">
  <span class="hamburger-box">
    <span class="hamburger-inner"></span>
  </span>
</button>

<!-- I'm a fancy div. my toggle class will be .is-active too -->
<div id="1" class="container" ng-class="{'is-active': toggle}">
  <p>Actually, that was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed.</p>
</div>
```
