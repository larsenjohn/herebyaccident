# Markdown and Kramdown

***

Here come the warm jets.

Hey, you might say "why on earth should I learn another language that will just do the same thing as HTML?" Or, "won't this just be a waste of time on an abstracted language no one will adopt?" Well fuck, you are absolutely right.

Let's get going.

This is all just a bastardized version of [this link](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) from Daring Fireball.

Github pages only supports [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) if you even care. But if you are using a jekyll specific site this will probably need to be mentioned in the `_config.yml` file like so:

    # Markdown
    markdown: kramdown

<br>

***

## Headings

<p># h1</p>
<p>## h2</p>
<p>### h3</p>
<p>#### h4</p>
<p>##### h5</p>
<p>###### h6</p>

<br>

## Emphasis

***

<p>*em*</p>
<p>**strong**</p>

<br>

*em*

**strong**


<br>

## Lists

***

<p>+ li</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; + li</p>

<p>1. ol</p>

<br>

+ li
  + li

1. ol

<br>

## Links

***

<p>[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)</p>
<p>[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")</p>
<p>[I'm a relative reference to a repository file in the root](/images/russell.jpg)</p>

<br>

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a relative reference to a to a repository file in the root](/images/russell.jpg)

<br>

<p>![jack in coat](/images/russell.jpg "Jack in coat title")</p>
![jack in coat](/images/russell.jpg "Jack in coat title")

<br>

You can also just do it the old fashioned way if you want classes

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/russell.jpg">

<br>

## Code

***

<p>`code in an inline block` with basic backticks</p>

`code in a block`

Drop this all 4 spaces in for a code block

    <script>
    var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
    alert(s);
    </script>


<br>

## Blockquotes

***

<p>>I'm a blockquote and I can use *markdown*</p>

>I'm a blockquote and I can use *markdown*

<br>

## Line Breaks

***

There is a totally weird way to use line breaks by double spacing right after a paragraph.

Like this  
I'm surpirsed this works  
Am I an idiot  
or is trailing white space a bad  
habit to get into?
