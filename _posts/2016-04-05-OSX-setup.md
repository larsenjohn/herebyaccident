# Common OSX Setup

Seems like every few weeks I blow up another system and forget all the crazy shit I did to it. This is just to spare me looking it all up again.

## Command Line Tools without Xcode

```
xcode-select --install
```

<hr class="rule">

## Show hidden files

```
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
```

Relaunch finder if it doesn't stick.

```
killall finder
```

## Change Mouse Scroll

Whomever came up with this *feature* should shot in the fucking teeth.

1. System Preferences >
2. Mouse >
3. Uncheck **Scroll direction: natural**
