# Youtube custom closed captioning

Youtube has a really fancy auto detect for closed captioning, but if you have a bunch of proprietary branding things go a little haywire. Simplest way to go about this is to transcribe everything in a plain text document beforehand.

You can also upload a full blown transcription file with best practices, but this works in a pinch.

## Navigate to the CC settings

The easiest way to get there is to login, navigate to your public (or private) video url, and **click the "CC" icon in the control bar under the video**.

Once you are in the CC settings, you can set your default language to english. Then go through the following steps.

1. **Select:** Add new subtitles or CC
2. **Choose:** English
3. **Choose:** Transcribe and auto-sync
4. Paste in your plain text of the transcription
5. **Select:** Set Timings
6. **Select:** Publish

## Check settings

Play the video with the CC captions on. It should now default to your "English" title. If you need to edit the transcriptions, click on your new CC setting and select the "Edit" button. In each table will be split up based on the automated time settings.
