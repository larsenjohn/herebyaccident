# Youtube custom closed captioning

Youtube has a really fancy auto detect for closed captioning, but if you have a bunch of proprietary branding things go a little haywire. Simplest way to go about this is to transcribe everything in a plain text document beforehand.

You can also upload a full blown transcription file with best practices, but this works in a pinch.

## Navigate to the CC settings

The easiest way to get there is to login, navigate to your public (or private) video url, and **click the "CC" icon in the control bar under the video**.

## Add new subtitles

Once you are in the CC settings, you can set your default language to english. Then go through the following steps.

+ **Select:** Add new subtitles or CC

+ Paste in your plain text of the transcription
+ **Select:** Set Timings

It will take a few seconds to chew on the transcription and sync the timing. Wait a moment and then click on your new CC setting.

+ Review your transcription
+ **Select:** Publish

## Check settings

Play the video with the CC captions on. It should now default to your "English" title. If you need to edit the transcriptions based on the timing, click on your new CC setting and select the "Edit" button. Each table will be split up based on the automated time settings.
